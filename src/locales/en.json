The dApp goal is decentralized finance (DeFi) and it has fixed total supply (of 1, 000, 000 tokens). All the tokens, including the basic system tokens (EFG and GPT) and collateral assets, are ECRC-20 standard which is similar with ERC-20 (Ethereum) standard. They are freely transferable by users, and they can be even delegate handling(allowance). Additionally, the system can also accept ECOC (the native coin).",

GPT provides the need for contract clearing extension because it can be used to increase the grace period for margin call notifications.

At the same time, EFG adopts hedging financial logic to achieve a high degree of balance and trust between the relationship between the borrower and the lender and the transaction market. Coin holders can use ECOC coins as collateral to withdraw. It solves the problem of holding cryptocurrency and those who need liquidity to invest in the cryptocurrency market without selling their assets.

Hedging refers to investors placing bets on positions opposite to current positions in order to reduce the cycle risk of portfolio value fluctuations. Hedging is a strategy followed by rational investors (low risk and low expected profit). Currently, hedging (also called hedging) can only be done with a pair of cryptocurrencies. But in the future, when more currencies are introduced into the system, the combination of mortgage assets can be applied to hedging strategies. Because GPT was created to support EFG loans, GPT is used to delay the settlement of mortgage assets. Therefore, no matter what the exchange rate is, these innovative tokens are designed to support investors’ asset investment strategies.",

The investor must pay interest to the system for the EFG token he received.  They are free to pay back their loan whenever they want. The investor must return exactly the amount of EFG token they borrowed plus the interest for the period elapsed. The interest rate is calculated daily, and the total interest depends on the block timestamps.  The investor has the option to receives a GPT rewarded token by staking EFG. This action brings him passive income because GPT has its value.  There is a demand for it because it can be used to increase the grace period of a margin call.",
